Unit 15 Homework: Visualizing Data with Leaflet

Background
The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. As a new hire, you will be helping them out with an exciting new project!
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

Before You Begin


Create a new repository for this project called leaflet-challenge, and please select VisualStudio as your .gitignore template.. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.


Clone the new repository to your computer.


Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the Leaflet challenge. Use the folder names to correspond to the challenges: Leaflet-Part-1 and Leaflet-Part-2.


This homework uses both HTML and JavaScript, so be sure to add all the necessary files. These will be the main files to run for analysis.


Push the above changes to GitHub.



Instructions
The instructions for this activity are broken into two parts:


Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization


Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional)



Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
Your first task is to visualize an earthquake dataset. Complete the following steps:


Get your dataset. To do so, follow these steps:

The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every five minutes. Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and choose a dataset to visualize. The following image is an example screenshot of what appears when you visit this link:
